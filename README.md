# Visual Studio Code gcc c++ repository starter for Windows
A vscode c++ repository starter mainly used for code jam, leetcode, hackerthon, online judge, etc.
## Prerequisite

### VS code extensions

* `ext install ms-vscode.cpptools`

    must have :)
* `ext install webfreak.debug`

    As the current debugger configuration in vs code is still buggy, I would recommend this extension for debugger configuration.
### install MinGW 
I install it under `D:/MinGW`.
### add `<Your MinGW>/bin` to system environment variables path.
